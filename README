le wild XMMS2 client is a simple media library browser for XMMS2, with a focus on keyboard operability.

The window is now single instance, so calling it again will only bring up the old window.
To have multiple instances running you can use "lwxc.py -i <instance_name>".

Dependencies are:
- python (tested with 3.3.0)
- python-gobject (2.28 or later)
- xmms2 (compiled from git devel branch with python3 bindings)
- python-dbus
